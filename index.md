## About Me
A Man Wearing Two Hats
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
Hello there! I'm Mehrzad, and if there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I've never been content sticking to just one playbook. Like a man wearing two hats, I've built my career and my life around two seemingly disparate worlds: the tangible, gritty realm of *engineering and construction*, and the abstract, ever-evolving domain of *science and technology*.


### The First Hat: Construction Supervisor

After finishing my **bachelor degree in civil engineering**, I started my professional journey in the construction industry. There's something profoundly satisfying about seeing architectural plans transform into towering structures right before your eyes. As a **construction site supervisor**, I learned the values of teamwork, precision, and the grit it takes to make visions come to life. Yet, I felt a pull towards another kind of construction—a construction of the future, through technology.

### The Second Hat: Researcher
The pull became irresistible, particularly during my **master's studies in Construction Project Management**, leading me to swap out my hard hat for the algorithms and lines of code. My days of orchestrating physical labor have translated remarkably well into managing computational methods for my master's thesis, centered around **Knowledge Graphs**, **Artificial Neural Networks**, and **Fuzzy Logic**.

### Worlds Collide: Becoming Data Scientist / Tech Innovator
But why choose one world when you can have the best of both? Exploring **Digital Twins** for the built environment during my **PhD studies**, I found myself at the crossroads of bricks and bytes, using my unique set of experiences to forge a new path. Over the years, I became obssesed with harnessing the power of **Deep Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, and digital technologies such as **AR/VR**, to redefine workflows in the construction world. Think of it not as a compromise between two worlds, but as a synergistic union—laying the digital groundwork for the physical infrastructures of tomorrow.


<!-- 
Major focus areas include:

- **Intuitive Interactions:** Utilizing advanced NLP techniques to enhance user experiences, whether it's for searching within a model or seeking recommendations based on building codes and regulations.

- **Multi-Modal Integration:** Pioneering the use of multi-modal data to enrich BIM models, including text, images, and sensor data for more comprehensive insights and applications.

- **Data Optimization:** Leveraging advanced algorithms to elevate BIM data quality and usability beyond conventional limits. 

- **Automated Workflows:** Harnessing the predictive and reasoning capabilities of AI techniques to automate intricate tasks such as BIM coordination and compliance checking.
